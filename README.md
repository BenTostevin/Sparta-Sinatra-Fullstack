# Sparta-Sinatra-Fullstack

## Description

This is a simple posts site for two different resources. You are able to view the posts on the index and also add, edit and delete posts for both resources.

## Purpose

The purpose of making this site was to give me experience in back-end web development and to give me a better understanding of how Sinatra Fullstack works.


## Issues

There are still some issues with the styling, as the layout is not currently the way I would like.
